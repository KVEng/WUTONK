abstract: 'Virtual Radio Access Network (vRAN) is an emerging approach offered by cloud providers to accelerate 5G services deployment. Despite significant microsecond-scale traffic variations, vRAN instances are provisioned based on peak load to meet strict latency requirements, leading to significant resource waste. Conceivably, vRAN can share CPUs with other applications to increase CPU utilization. Yet, existing sharing solutions require modifications to vRAN source code, hindering their deployment on public clouds. We present Aquifer, a microsecond-scale scheduler providing transparent CPU sharing for vRAN workloads. Our key observation is a common producer-consumer task execution pattern in mainstream vRAN implementations. We exploit this pattern to reclaim CPU cores from worker threads only at the boundary of processing different tasks. This guarantees run-to-completion task processing, which is critical for vRAN to achieve low latency and stability. Aquifer intercepts system calls invoked by vRAN at the OS layer to achieve transparent load monitoring and core reallocation. Aquifer employs a set of system-level optimizations on thread state detection, signal transmission and core selection, which reduces the scheduling cycle to 2 Î¼ s. Experimental results show that Aquifer reclaims up to 88.31% of wasted CPU resources for two mainstream vRAN implementations, FlexRAN and OAI, without any source code modifications.'
