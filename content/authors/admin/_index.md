<h1> About Me </h1>
I am a second-year Ph.D. student studying computer science in the <a href=https://github.com/pkusys> Computer Systems Research Group </a> at Peking University where I am advised by <a href=https://xinjin.github.io> Xin Jin</a>.

I have a broad interest in building efficient systems for training and serving deep learning models, with a primary focus on large language models (LLMs) currently.

I am also an enthusiastic self-learner and interested in various fields of computer science. I have built [a website](https://csdiy.wiki/en) to share my self-learning experiences and resources.
